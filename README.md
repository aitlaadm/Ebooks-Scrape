## TECH STACK
1. [BeatifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
2. [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

## Run
1. Clone this repository ```https://github.com/aitlaadm/Ebooks-Scrape.git/```
2. Start running streamlit app with following command ```streamlit run streamlit_app.py```

## Notes
1. In this case, we need to install all libraries in ```requirements.txt```
2. Because we want to store (append) data in csv, we need to create a csv first named ```output.csv``` in the main directory and fill the header and keep the rest empty.
